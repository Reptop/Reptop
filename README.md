Sleep deprived undergraduate double majoring in Computer Science and Math with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University. Am currently interested in competitive programming.

Prior experiences:

- Computer Science and Math double major at Oregon State University; currently seeking a software 
 engineering internship.
- Proficient in Java, C/C++, and Python with 6+ years of experience. 
- Proficient in Linux/Unix with 4 years of experience
- Taught Python, Javascript, and basic computer science concepts to kids aged 7-12 at Code Ninjas.

I possess a love and aptitude for teaching and helping others in computer science. Distilling down complex concepts and digestible content for kids increased my appreciation for education and my own teachers; I hope to continue to hone my skills throughout my undergraduate degree :)

I'm currently using svelte for my fullstack projects!
